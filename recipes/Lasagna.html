    <h2>How to Make Lasagna</h2>
    <p>
      Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the
      wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven
      preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes,
      then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's important
      to let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before
      you cut into it.

        Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground
        beef.

        Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the
        meat to add tons of flavor.

        Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of
        tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
