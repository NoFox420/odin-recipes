    <h2>How to Make Ranch Chicken Tacos</h2>
    <p>
      These ranch chicken tacos are a great change from regular Mexican-style
      tacos.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quick, cool summer dinner made with leftover rotisserie chicken.
      Naturally, you can use any type of chicken cooked the way you like; just
      be sure to shred it for real tacos.

    <li>
      <ul>
        ½ cup ranch dressing
      </ul>
      <ul>
        ¼ cup reduced-fat sour cream
      </ul>
      <ul>
        1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix, divided
      </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <li>
      <ol>
        Combine ranch dressing, sour cream, 1 teaspoon taco seasoning, and salsa
        in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until serving.
      </ol>
      <ol>
        Toss chicken with remaining taco seasoning. Cover bowl loosely with wax
        paper or plastic wrap. Microwave chicken until chicken is heated
        through, about 2 to 3 minutes.
      </ol>
      <ol>
        Warm tortillas in a skillet for about a minute on each side to make them
        pliable. Place a scoop of chicken on the tortilla and top with lettuce,
        tomato, green onion, olives, avocado, cheese, and a spoonful of the
        ranch dressing mixture.
